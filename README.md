# `NEAR Library` Starter Kit

ðŸ“„ Introduction
==================

NEAR Library is a smart contract where you can to create, rate, comment, store and transfer books using the NEAR protocol, making a library online where you can request one book and change the owner. The following are the main functionalities of this smart contract:

1. Add a Book to the library.
2. Get the list of all Books.
3. Get only the books that you added. 
4. Rate a book.
5. Add a comment where you describe why do you liked... or not.
6. Transfer the book to another Owner.

ðŸ“¦ Installation
================

To run this project locally you need to follow the next steps:

Step 1: Prerequisites
------------------------------

1. Make sure you've installed rust(https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Make sure you've installed wasm: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly`
3. Install dependencies/build wasm: `Cargo build +nightly --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
4. Create a test near account [NEAR test account](https://wallet.testnet.near.org/)
5. Install the NEAR CLI globally: [near-cli](https://docs.near.org/docs/tools/near-cli) is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain


Step 2: Configure your NEAR CLI
-------------------------------

Configure your near-cli to authorize your test account recently created:

    near login

Step 3: Build and make a smart contract development deploy(Need update)
--------------------------------

 - Compile with `cargo +nightly build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release`
 - Create a subaccount to hold this contract: `near create-account contract-name.your-account-name.testnet --masterAccount your-account-name.testnet --initialBalance 100`.
 - Deploy this contract: `near deploy --accountId contract-name.your-account-name.testnet --wasmFile './target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/library.wasm'
 - Call functions in it then delete the account when it's no longer needed.

You can also follow the instructions on the folder *scripts*.


ðŸ“‘ Exploring the NEAR library smart contract methods 
==================

The following commands allow you to interact with the smart contract methods using the NEAR CLI (for this you need to have a provisional smart contract deployed).

Information: the command for rate will require especific data (AccountId, Rate)
 
Rate values: 

    - The value 0 represents a bad rate.
    - The value 1 represents a regular rate.  
    - The value 2 represents a awesome rate.    


Command to add a book: 
--------------------------------------------

```bash
near call $CONTRACT AddBook '{"isbn": "string","name":"string","description":"string","numpage":"number","author":"string","datepublished":"date","editions":"number"}' --account-id <your test account>
```

Command to get all the books on the library:
--------------------------------------------

```bash
near view $CONTRACT getBooks
```

Command to get a specific book in the library:
--------------------------------------------

```bash
near view $CONTRACT getBook '{"id":int}'
```

Command to get the number of Books added:
--------------------------------------------

```bash
near view <your deployed contract> getNBooks
```

**Thing that we can add in the future**

Command to rate a book:
--------------------------------------------

```bash
 near call $CONTRACT rate '{"id":3,"valor":2}' --accountId joehank.testnet
```
Command to see the rates of a book:
--------------------------------------------

```bash
 near call $CONTRACT rate '{"id":3}' --accountId joehank.testnet
```

Command to comment a book:
--------------------------------------------

```bash
 near call $CONTRACT comment '{"id":3,"comment":"i love it"}' --accountId joehank.testnet
```
Command to see the rates of a book:
--------------------------------------------

```bash
 near call $CONTRACT getComments '{"id":3}' --accountId joehank.testnet
```
